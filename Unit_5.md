## Q.6 Define and explain the following (any three):  
  a) Transaction validation  
  b) Know your customer  
  c) Cryptocurrency  
  d) Creation of coin (2024)

## 📘 Definitions and Explanations

---

## a) ✅ Transaction Validation

**Transaction validation** is the process by which transactions are verified before being added to the blockchain. This ensures that the transaction is legitimate, follows the rules of the network, and prevents issues such as double spending.

### How it works:
1. **Transaction is broadcast** to the network.
2. **Nodes** check if the sender has enough balance and proper digital signatures.
3. **Validators or miners** include the transaction in a new block.
4. Once confirmed and added to the chain, the transaction becomes immutable.

Validation is a critical step in maintaining the integrity and trust in decentralized systems.

---

## b) 🧾 Know Your Customer (KYC)

**Know Your Customer (KYC)** refers to the process financial institutions and blockchain platforms use to verify the identity of their users. It’s a regulatory requirement to prevent illegal activities like money laundering, fraud, and terrorist financing.

### KYC Process Includes:
- Collecting official ID (passport, driver’s license)
- Proof of address (utility bills, bank statements)
- Biometric verification (selfies, face scans)

KYC is often mandatory for centralized crypto exchanges but is debated in decentralized finance (DeFi) for privacy concerns.

---

## c) 🪙 Cryptocurrency

A **cryptocurrency** is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on a decentralized ledger called the **blockchain**.

### Key Features:
- **Decentralized**: No central authority controls it.
- **Secure**: Uses cryptographic techniques.
- **Limited Supply**: Most cryptocurrencies have a capped supply (e.g., Bitcoin: 21 million).
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Enables direct transactions without intermediaries.

Popular examples include **Bitcoin (BTC)**, **Ethereum (ETH)**, and **Solana (SOL)**.

Cryptocurrencies are used for payments, investments, powering decentralized apps (dApps), and tokenized assets.

## Q.7 Define and explain the following:  

  a) Digital Signature (2024)

## 📘 Digital Signature

A **Digital Signature** is a cryptographic technique used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message, document, or transaction in digital communications. It serves as the equivalent of a handwritten signature or a stamped seal, but with added security.

## How it works:

1. **Message Hashing**: 
   - The message or document is first passed through a cryptographic hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256), which produces a fixed-size hash value (a unique representation of the message).
   
2. **Private Key Encryption**:
   - The sender encrypts the hash value using their **private key** to create the digital signature. The private key is kept secure and is never shared.

3. **Verification with Public Key**:
   - The recipient decrypts the signature using the sender's **public key**, which allows them to retrieve the original hash value.
   
4. **Comparison**:
   - The recipient then hashes the received message and compares it to the decrypted hash value. If they match, it confirms that the message hasn’t been altered and is indeed from the sender.

## Key Features:
- **Authentication**: Confirms the sender's identity.
- **Integrity**: Ensures that the message has not been altered in transit.
- **Non-repudiation**: Prevents the sender from denying having sent the message.

## Use Cases:
- **Blockchain**: Used for verifying transactions and ensuring that they come from legitimate sources.
- **Email**: Used to sign emails for ensuring that they are from the claimed sender.
- **Document Signing**: Used in legal contracts and agreements to prove authenticity.

### Example:
In a blockchain, when a user sends a transaction, they create a digital signature using their private key. This signature is verified by nodes using the user's public key, ensuring that the transaction is valid and hasn’t been tampered with.
