## Q.1 What is a Blockchain? Describe its Structure with a Suitable Diagram.

### ✅ Definition:

A **blockchain** is a **decentralized**, **distributed ledger** that records transactions across multiple computers so that the record cannot be changed later without also changing all the blocks that come after it and getting approval from the network.

It is a chain of **blocks**, where each block contains data, a hash of the block, and the hash of the previous block — forming a secure and immutable chain.

---

### 🧠 Key Characteristics of Blockchain:

- **Decentralized**: No central authority manages it.
- **Distributed**: Data is shared across multiple nodes.
- **Immutable**: Once recorded, data cannot be changed.
- **Transparent**: All transactions are visible to authorized participants.

---

### 🧱 Structure of a Block in Blockchain:

Each block typically contains:

1. **Block Header**

   - **Block Number**: Index of the block in the chain.
   - **Previous Hash**: Hash of the previous block.
   - **Timestamp**: Time when the block was created.
   - **Nonce**: A number used in mining (for Proof of Work).
   - **Merkle Root**: Root hash of all transactions in the block.

2. **Transaction Data**
   - List of valid transactions.

---

### 🔗 Blockchain Structure Diagram:

- Each block contains the **hash of the previous block**, which forms a chain.
- Changing one block would require changing all subsequent blocks, making blockchain **tamper-resistant**.

## Q.5 Explain Digital Signature with an Example

### ✅ What is a Digital Signature?

A **digital signature** is a cryptographic technique used to validate the **authenticity** and **integrity** of digital data. It is the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or a stamped seal, but much more secure.

It ensures that:

- The **message was created by a known sender (authentication)**.
- The **message was not altered in transit (integrity)**.
- The **sender cannot deny sending the message (non-repudiation)**.

---

### 🔐 How Does a Digital Signature Work?

Digital signatures use **public-key cryptography** (also called asymmetric cryptography), which involves a **key pair**:

- **Private Key** (kept secret): Used to sign the message.
- **Public Key** (shared with others): Used to verify the signature.

---

### 🧠 Steps Involved

1. **Message Hashing**: The original message is hashed using a hash function (e.g., SHA-256).
2. **Signing**: The sender encrypts the hash using their **private key** to generate a **digital signature**.
3. **Transmission**: The message and the digital signature are sent to the receiver.
4. **Verification**: The receiver:
   - Hashes the received message again.
   - Decrypts the digital signature using the **sender’s public key**.
   - Compares the two hashes:
     - If they match → the message is authentic and unaltered.
     - If they don’t → the message is either tampered with or not from the original sender.

---

### ✉️ Example

Let’s say Alice wants to send a secure message to Bob:

- Message: `"I owe you 10 BTC."`
- Alice creates a hash of this message.
- She encrypts the hash with her **private key** to create the **digital signature**.
- She sends Bob both:
  - The original message
  - The digital signature

Bob uses Alice’s **public key** to verify the signature:

- He hashes the message himself.
- He decrypts the digital signature using Alice’s public key.
- If the two match, Bob knows:
  - The message came from Alice.
  - The message was not altered.

---

### 🔐 Use of Digital Signature in Blockchain

- Used in **cryptocurrency transactions** to prove the ownership of funds.
- Ensures that only the **owner of the private key** can authorize a transaction.
- Every transaction on a blockchain is signed using the **sender’s private key** and verified using their **public key**.

---

### 📌 Advantages

- **Authentication**: Confirms identity of the sender.
- **Integrity**: Confirms the message was not tampered with.
- **Non-repudiation**: The sender cannot deny sending the message.
- **Efficiency**: Fast and reliable verification using public key.

---

### 📝 Conclusion

A digital signature is a **critical component of blockchain security**, enabling **secure, tamper-proof, and verifiable communication** without the need for intermediaries. It ensures trust in a trustless system like blockchain.

- Each block contains a **set of transactions**, a **timestamp**, and a **link to the previous block**, forming a **chain of blocks** — hence the name _blockchain_.
- This ensures **security, transparency, and immutability** in the Bitcoin network.

## 🪙 Steps of Coin Creation (Bitcoin Mining Process)

The process of **creating new Bitcoins** is called **mining**. It involves validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain.

### 🔁 Steps in Coin Creation (Mining Process)

1. ### 🧾 **Transaction Initiation**

   - A Bitcoin transaction is initiated when a user sends BTC to another.
   - This transaction is broadcast to the network.

2. ### 📦 **Transaction Pool (Mempool)**

   - Unconfirmed transactions enter the **memory pool**.
   - Miners collect transactions from this pool to form a new block.

3. ### 🧠 **Block Formation**

   - Miners bundle several transactions into a block.
   - A **Merkle Root** is created using all transaction hashes.

4. ### 🔐 **Proof of Work (PoW)**

   - Miners must solve a **complex mathematical puzzle** (hash function).
   - They try different **nonces** until a hash less than the target is found.
   - This requires **massive computation power**.

5. ### 🏁 **Block Verification**

   - Once a miner finds the correct hash, they broadcast the new block to the network.
   - Other nodes verify:
     - Validity of the block,
     - Correct PoW,
     - Transactions included.

6. ### ⛓️ **Block Added to Blockchain**

   - After verification, the block is added to the blockchain.
   - This block now becomes part of the permanent ledger.

7. ### 🎉 **Reward & Coin Creation**
   - The successful miner is rewarded with:
     - **Newly minted Bitcoins** (called **block reward**),
     - **Transaction fees** from the included transactions.
   - This is how **new Bitcoins are created** in the system.

### 📌 Note on Block Reward Halving

- Initially: 50 BTC/block (2009)
- Halves every 210,000 blocks (~4 years)
- Current reward (as of 2024): **6.25 BTC/block** → **now 3.125 BTC/block (2024 Halving)**

### 💡 Conclusion

- **Bitcoin relies on blockchain** to maintain a transparent and secure system of digital transactions.
- The **mining process** not only validates transactions but also **creates new Bitcoins**, securing the network and incentivizing miners.
